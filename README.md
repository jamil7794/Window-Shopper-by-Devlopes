Placeholders are implented with NSAttributes. we used color literal, opacity, text color. Placeholder is the string that should be replaced when we input a text 
# Febb 24 2018, 5:55 PM: Implemented a UIButton in the IOS keyboard. Set Background, color, and title. Used a function inputAccessoryView: It's a function that makes the IOS keyboard appear with the calculate button. In addTarget we used a #selector as action: #selector should be an objective-c implementation, SO later when we call a function, The function should be an Objective-C function.
# Febb 25 2018, 1:05 AM: Used unit testing. Created a momdel to calculate the hours to purchase an item. Then, We added a tester that make sure that the functin in Wage.swift works. This is a good programic practice because we need to test whether a function runs.
# Febb 25 2018, 2:48 AM: Almost finishing the app. Worked with the logic of the app. We use clear calculator button to clear the the wages and item price.
